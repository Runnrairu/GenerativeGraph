## Usage

### Enviroments (CPU/GPU)
Pull the Envrioments for this implementation.  
`docker pull relutropy/research`  

Start jupyter server by below command.  
`In container $ nohup jupyter notebook --allow-root >> jupyter.log 2>&1 &`  

### Codes on Jupyter Notebooks
`git clone https://github.com/shllln/GenerativeGraph.git`  


#### Welcome PR and issue.
This is prtotype.  
There are some differences from the paper.  
For example, h_v_init has no condition vector and Datasets is Tox21 now.  
That will match the paper soon.
